Precursor - python_68d
Changes
The primary purpose of this version was to reduce the size of the windsave file which for a 30x30 grid and a particular set of macro atoms was 500 Mbytes. The new version reduces the size of the same windsave file to 17Mbytes. Note that the so-called CoolStruc ? has been eliminated and those variables are now allocated directly from MacroMain ? . On restarts, the freebound probabilities for macro atoms are now recalibrated.
Minor changes to other routines have been made mostly to eliminate very old comments and/or deleted code
Note - Be sure to dwonlaod the new version of kpar in Python_68e as well.
