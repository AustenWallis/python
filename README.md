precursor - python_70e
This version fixes a major problem that photons were not being detected as they came into the torus region. The main changes are in photon2d.c and torus,c but other change some purely documentation were made in ionization.c, phot_util.c, python.c, radiation.c, saha.c, stuart_sim.c, wind.c. Also, changes were made to py_wind.c and py_wind_subs.c to make it easier to see various variables.
I have not attempted to address problems regarding wind emission or anything having to do with ionization though I did begin to look to see what was going on here.
