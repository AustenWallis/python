Central_object.radiation
========================
A booliean variable stating whether of not the central object should radiate.
This will enable different follow-up questions depending on the system type.

**Type:** Boolean (yes/no)

**File:** setup_star_bh.c


Central_object.geometry_for_source
----------------------------------
If the central source in an AGN/BH system is radiating, what geometry should it radiate from?
 This is applicable even for black-body sources, where the *luminosity* depends on :ref:`Central_object.radius`.

**Type:** Enumerator

**Values:**

lamp_post
  The central source radiates from two point sources
  located on the system axis above and below the disk plane.
  Emission is completely isotropic.

sphere
  The central source radiates from a spherical surface with radius :ref:`Central_object.radius`.
  Emission is cosine-weighted in the direction of the sphere normal at the point of emission.
  Photons that would be spawned in an extended disk (if :ref:`Disk.type` is `vertically.extended`)
  are re-generated.

Central_object.rad_type_in_final_spectrum
-----------------------------------------
Determines the SED of the central object in the spectral cycles. The luminosity is set by the options for the
ionisation cycles, however.

**Type:** Enumerator

**Values:**

bb
  Available for :ref:`System_type` of `star` or `cv`.
  Black-body radiation. The boundary layer radiates as a black-body source with surface luminosity set by its
  effective temperature (:ref:`Central_object.temp`) and resulting in a total luminosity
  proportional to its surface area.

models
  Available for :ref:`System_type` of `star` or `cv`.
  Radiate according to a model. Python can support tabulated models that output with a binned luminosity distribution
  depending on system properties like temperature and gravity. See :ref:`Input_spectra.model_file`. The total
  luminosity will be set by :ref:`Central_object.luminosity`.

uniform
  Available for :ref:`System_type` of `star` or `cv`.
  Photons are generated with a random, uniformly-distributed wavelength between
  :ref:`Spectrum.wavemin` and :ref:`Spectrum.wavemax`. Can in some cases substitute for a Kurcuz spectrum.
  This mode is only available when generating final spectra.

brems
  Available for :ref:`System_type` of `agn` or `bh`.
  Central object radiates with SED of a brehmsstralung spectrum as $L_\nu=\nu^{\alpha}e^{-h\nu/kT}$.
  This was originally developed to allow comparison to spectra generated
  according to Blondin heating and cooling rates.

cloudy
  Available for :ref:`System_type` of `agn` or `bh`.
  Central object radiates with a 'broken' power law, intended largely for testing purposes against Cloudy.
  The SED form is $L_\nu=K\nu^\alpha$, but beyond the provided high and low energy
  breakpoints the luminosity falls off sharply.

power
  Available for :ref:`System_type` of `agn` or `bh`.
  Radiate following a power-law model as $L_\nu=K\nu^\alpha$.
  The total luminosity will be set by :ref:`Boundary_layer.luminosity`.
