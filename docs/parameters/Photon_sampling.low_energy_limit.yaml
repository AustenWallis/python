name: Photon_sampling.low_energy_limit
description: |
  During the ionization phase, stratified sampling is used to provide good coverage of the full ionizing spectrum. This
  parameter sets the lowest envergy (frequency) of for phtoons to be generated whne the user wants to customize the
  bands.
type: Double
unit: eV
values: greater than 0 
parent:
  parameter: This parameter is required whenever the user wants to customize the bands for stratified smapling in the ionzation phase
