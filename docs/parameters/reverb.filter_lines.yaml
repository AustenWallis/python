name: reverb.filter_lines
description: |
  Multi-line description, must keep indentation.
type: Int
values:
  0: Off. Include *all* photons that contribute to the spectra in the output
  file. Not recommended as it leads to gargantuan file sizes.
  -1: Filter out continuum. Include all photons whose last interaction was scatter
  or emission in a line. Recommended setting for exploratory runs where you'd
  like to identify which lines are the easiest to process.
  N: Filter lines. Include N reverb.filter_line entries, each specifying one
  line to keep in the output file. If reverb.matom_lines is >0, all macro-atom
  lines of interest are automatically included in the filter list.
