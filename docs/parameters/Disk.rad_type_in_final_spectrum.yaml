name: Rad_type_for_disk_in_final_spectrum
description: |
  If the system contains a disk then the spectrum of the disk is generally simulated either a collection of blackbodies
  based on the temperature, as an appropriately weighted set of stellar atomosphers.  One can also simply generate
  a flat spectrum, in which case the relative contribution of different annulae is based on the wavelength limited 
  luminostiy in each annulus, something that is usually done only for diagnostic purposes.
