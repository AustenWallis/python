name: Diag.fractional_distance_photon_may_travel
description: |
  The distance photon may travel in a cell is limited to prevent a photon
  from moving such a long path that the velocity may change non-linearly.
  This problem arises primarily when the photon is travelling azimuthally
  in the grid.  This changes the default for the fraction of the maximum
  distance in a cell.
