name: Wind.dim.in.x_or_r.direction
description: |
  Winds are calulated on spherical, cylindrical, or polar grids.
  This input variable gives the size of the grid in the x or r
  direction.  Because some grid cells are used as a buffer, the
  actual wind cells are contained in a slightly smaller grid than
  the number given.

  Note that in some situations there may be more than one wind
  component, known technically as a domain.  In that case the user
  will be queried for this value mulitple times, one for each domain
