name: Line_transfer
description: |
  The way in which line transfer and scattering is dealt with
  in the code. Governs whether we adopt any approximations
  for radiative transfer, whether to use the indivisible packet
  and macro-atom machinery, and whether to use isotropic or
  anisotropic scattering.

  Mode 5 is recommended for non-macro atom runs,
  while mode 7 is recommended for macro-atom runs.

type: Enum (Int)
values:
  pure_abs: |
    *Pure absorption*

    The pure absortion approximation.

  pure_scat: |
    *Pure scattering*

    The pure scattering approximation.

  sing_scat: |
    *Single scattering*

    The single scattering approximation.

  escape_prob: |
    *Escape probability*

    Resonance scattering and electron scattering is dealt with isotropically.
    free-free, compton and bound-free opacities attenuate the weight of the photon
    wind emission produces additional photons, which have their directions chosen isotropically.
    The amount of radiation produced is attenuated by the escape probability.

  thermal_trapping: |
    *Escape probability + anisotropic scattering*

    as mode 4, but we use
    the 'thermal trapping method' to choose an
    anistropic direction when an r-packet deactivation
    or scatter occurs.

  macro_atoms: |
    *Macro-atoms*

    use macro-atom line transfer.
    Packets are indivisible and thus all opacities are dealt with by activate a macro-atom, scattering,
    or creating a k-packet.
    the new direction following electron scattering or deactivation of
    a macro atom is chosen isotropically.

  macro_atoms_thermal_trapping: |
    *Macro-atoms + anisotropic scattering*

    as macro_atoms, but we use the 'thermal trapping method' to choose an anistropic direction
    when an r-packet deactivation or scatter occurs.
