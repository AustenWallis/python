name: high_energy_break
description: |
  This is a command to define a cloudy type broken power 
  law SED - mainly used for testing the code against cloudy. 
  This SED has hardwired frequency exponents of 2.5 below the
  low energy break and -2.0 abov e the high energy break. This
  parameter defines the energy of the high energy break.
type: Double
unit: eV
values: Greater than zero and also greater than low_energy_break
