name: Photon_sampling.band_min_frac
description: |
  When specifying manually the bands used for generating photons during the ionization pahse, this
  parameter specifies the The minimum fraction of photons to be generated in this energy band. 
  The number of times this parameter will be reqested depends upon the number of bands.  The summ
  of the fractuibs need not sum to 1, in which case the remaining photons will be distributed according
  to the luminosity in the energy bands

type: Double
unit: None
values: Greater than 0 and should sum to less than 1 over all bands
parent:
  parameter: This parameter is requested whenever the user manually specifies the bands.
