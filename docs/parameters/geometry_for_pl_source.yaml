  Choose the geometry for the power law source.
type: Enum (Int)
values:
  0: |
    *sphere*

    The power law source is a sphere with radius equal to 
    the radius of the central object. In a BH system this is 
    often set to the ISCO. 

  1: |
    *lamp_post* 

    The power law source is a single point at some height above the origin. 
    Photons radiate isotropically from this point. The height is specified in 
    a subsequent parameter, lamp_post.height.
