name: Wind_radiation
description: |
  If this value is true (>0) then radiation from the wind,
  sometimes called diffuse radiations, is
  included in the calculation both of the ionization state
  of the wind, and in the final spectrum.  This parameter is
  only relevant when radiative transfer is carried out in the
  two level approximation.
