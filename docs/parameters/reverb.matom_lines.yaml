name: reverb.matom_lines
description: |
  Number of macro-atom lines to track paths for individually. This many
  reverb.matom_line entries are required, and the line associated with each has
  the path of photons deexciting into it recorded in its own array. Note: This
  doesn't give rise to any noticable differences to the pure wind mode in most
  simulations.
