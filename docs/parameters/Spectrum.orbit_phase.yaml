name: Spectrum.orbit_phase
description: |
  For binary systems, the orbital phase at which the spectrum
  is to be extracted (so the effects of an eclipse can be taken
  into account in creating the spectrum. Phase 0 corresponds to
  inferior conjunciton, that is with the secondary in front (or 
  depending on inclination angle, partially in front of) the
  primary
type: Double
unit: None
values: Normally between 0 and 1

  parameter: |
      Only required when the system is a described as a binary
