name: Photon_sampling.high_energy_limit
description: |
    Stratified sampling is used during ionization cycles to generate photons.  This parmeter
    specires the high energy limit for the frequenies of photons to be generated..
type: Double
unit: eV
values: greater than 0 
parent:
  parameter: This paremeter is requied whenever the user wants to customize energy bands for stratified sampling
