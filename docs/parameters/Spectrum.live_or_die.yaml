name: Spectrum.live.or.die
description: |
  Normally in creating detailed spectrum Python "extracts" photons in a certain
  direction rewithing them to account for the fact that they have been extracted
  in a certain direction.  It is possible to just count the photons that are emitted
  in a single angle range. The two methods should yield the same or very similar results 
  but the extraction method is much more efficient and live or die is basically a 
  diagnostic mode.  For historical reaaons the live or die method is called with 0
  and anything else rsults in the standard extract method being used.
