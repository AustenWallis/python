description: |
  Choose the geometry for the power law source.
type: Enum (Int)
values:
  sphere: |
    *Sphere*

    The power law source is a sphere with radius equal to
    the radius of the central object. In a BH system this is
    often set to the ISCO.

  lamp_post: |
    *Lamp-post*

    The power law source is a single point at some height above the origin.
    Photons radiate isotropically from this point. The height is specified in
    a subsequent parameter, lamp_post.height.
