reverb.disk_type
-----

Setting for how photons generated in the disk are treated when generating path
distributions for wind cells.

**Type:** Enum (Int)

Values
-----
0. *Correlated*

  This mode assumes that disk emission is correlated with the
  central source. Photons generated in the disk start with a delay equal to
  the direct distance to the central source. This assumes that the ionisation
  state and luminosity of the disk surface layer is mostly determined by
  unscattered photons from the central source.


1. *Uncorrelated*

  This mode generates photons with a delay of 0 wherever in the
  disk they come from. This mode is of slightly questionable use and should be
  ignored in preference to 0 or 2. It will, in practise, generally work out
  similar to type 0 as most of the UV photons are generated close-in to the CO.


2. *Ignored*

  This mode assumes that disk photons do *not* correlate
  with the central source (i.e. disk surface  ionisation state and emissivity is
  driven not by irradiation from the CO but by the mass inflow). This means that
  whilst they contribute to heating the wind, they do not strongly contribute to
  the lags for a given line. Photons generated by the disk do not contribute to
  the path distributions in the wind in this mode.

  By removing the (generally) short-delay disk photons from the wind path
  distributions, this will slightly bias them towards the longer delays
  associated with wind self-heating/excitation.

reverb.type
-----

Whether to perform reverberation mapping. Reverberation mapping tracks the
path of photons emitted in the simulation as they travel through the geometry,
assuming that any delays from recombination etc. are negligible and all delays
are due to light travel time. For each final spectrum, all contributing
photons are output to a '.delay_dump' file that can then be processed using
our 'tfpy' Python (no relation) library.

**Type:** Enum (Int)

Values
-----
0. Off.

1. *Simple 'photon' mode*

  Each photon is assigned an initial path based on its distance from the
  central source (assuming emission in the disk and wind is correlated with
  emission from the CO).


2. *Wind mode*

  CO photons are assigned paths as in Photon mode, disk photons are assigned
  paths as set by the reverb.disk_type parameter. Photons generated in the
  wind are assigned a path based on the *distribution* of paths of photons
  that have contributed to continuum absorption in that cell.


3. *Macro-atom mode*

  This works as wind mode, but for a number of specified macro-atom lines
  paths are tracked for those photons who cause a deexcitation into a given
  line. When a photon is emitted in one of those lines, the path is drawn from
  that specific distribution. This distribution is build up not just from the
  last cycle of the simulation, but from all cycles after the wind achieves
  >90% convergence. This is necessary as some lines are poorly-sampled.

  This mode gives pretty much identical results to wind mode, but at least we
  made it to check rather than just assuming it would be fine.

-----
reverb.visualisation
-----

Which type of visualisation to output, if any. Reverb modes that keep arrays
of photon paths per cell can output them either as averages in a 3d model, or
as a selection of flat text files with full bin-by-bin breakdowns. Useful for
diagnostics.

**Type:** Enum (Int)

Values
-----
0. None

1. .vtk. Outputs mean incident path per cell, photon count per cell, and mean
  observed delay to '.vtk' format, readable using a range of programs including
  (my preferred option) VisIt, available at https://visit.llnl.gov/.


2. cell_dump. Outputs distributions of paths for continuum heating and each
  line to a range of 'dump cells' specified by X & Z position using the
  reverb.dump_cells/reverb.dump_cell options.


3. Output to both .vtk and .dump_cell.
