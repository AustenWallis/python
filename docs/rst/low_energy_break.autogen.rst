This is a command to define a cloudy type broken power 
law SED - mainly used for testing the code against cloudy. 
This SED has hardwired frequency exponents of 2.5 below the
low energy break and -2.0 abov e the high energy break. This
parameter defines the energy of the low energy break.

**Type:** Double

**Unit:** eV

**Value:** Greater than zero

**Parent(s):**
  Rad_type_for_agn_: 4
